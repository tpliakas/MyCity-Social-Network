### Mapbox store locator with React.js

In [TicketMap.js](https://github.com/tpliakas/MyCity-Social-Network/blob/master/client/src/components/tickets/TicketMap.js)
you can see an implementation of [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and its 
[store locator](https://www.mapbox.com/use-cases/store-locator) with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

It's an interactive map with a list of the locations showing on it. With flyTo location and
popups on markers.
